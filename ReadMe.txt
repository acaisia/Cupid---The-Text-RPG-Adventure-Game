Read Me:

Not long ago, I completed my second Novel Cupid's Rising....
Soon to become a Comic Book Series, I decided to make a simple game in ruby for it.

Structure:

There is one file the game needs to continue from where you left off, and that is save; it has no extension, and stores
important information about the Human such as inventory, and location, and position on a grid, and level and much more!

If there is no file for it, don't fret, set up for a new game is easy!
The MC of the Novel introduces himself to you briefly and holds s very brief conversation to establish yourself in the
world of Velsaron...

If there is a game file to load, the MC welcomes you back and hands you back your implant to keep all items forever!

Once the game is established, meaning the values are stored for your character, it brings you to a menu. The Scene #
is displayed, and a list of menu options are presented with #ids in front of them. Use the #ids to select the option.
Game updates every 15 seconds once the full loop is expended, just tell your friends it is thinking ;)

Any menu listing with ()s use the inside character to access that option. i.e. (A)cess or Sa(V)e

All inputs are case sensitive.

While at the main game menu, if you type nothing and hit enter, it gives a friendly reminder that you can exit the game
from this menu by typing "Exit".

About the Save File...
So the game saves to a file called save with no extension.

If you open the file in notepad (which you can) you will find your character name, followed by a series of numbers, then
a list, finally a number. The numbers all correpsond to various variables in the game, which are important for returning
to a prior game state. It is not recommended that you modify these values, as it can harm game play negatively. The list
should look familiar if you ever checked your inventory.

Self Menu:

From Self, you can save, view your stats, check on your fatigue and health, and Check Inventory.
